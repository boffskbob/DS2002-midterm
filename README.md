# DS2002-midterm

This project utilizes Microsoft's Adventureworks Database, as well as theoretical product reviews and sales periods generated by AI. AI was not used on any other portion of this assignment.

The database can be set up locally by running the db_setup ipynb. This will require personal configuration of SQL and mongo credentials, however. Additionally, the populate_dimdate and adventureworks_mysql.sql files also have to be run in mysql.
